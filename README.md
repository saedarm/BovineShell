# BovineShell üêÆüîä

> The Windows Terminal Cow That Actually Speaks!

BovineShell brings your terminal to life by combining the classic cowsay ASCII art with Windows text-to-speech capabilities. Now your terminal cows don't just display messages - they speak them out loud!



## Quick Install

### Option 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

Copy and paste this one-liner in PowerShell to install everything:

```powershell
iex (iwr -useb https://github.com/saedarm/BovineShell/blob/main/Install.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Install Scoop if it's not already installed
2. Add the BovineShell bucket
3. Install BovineShell and its dependencies

### Option 2: Manual Install

If you prefer to install step-by-step:

```powershell
# Install Scoop if you don't have it
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

# Install cowsay (dependency)
scoop install cowsay

# Add the BovineShell bucket
scoop bucket add BovineShell https://github.com/saedarm/BovineShell

# Install BovineShell
scoop install BovineShell
```

## Basic Usage

```powershell
BovineShell "Hello, I can talk!"
```

This displays an ASCII cow and speaks the message using your default Windows voice.

## Advanced Examples

### Different Characters

```powershell
BovineShell -Message "I am a penguin" -Character tux
BovineShell -Message "Roar!" -Character dragon
```

To see all available characters:
```powershell
cowsay -l
```

### Voice Options

BovineShell uses the Windows System.Speech capabilities which come with the following voices pre-installed:

- **Microsoft David Desktop** - Male English (US) voice
- **Microsoft Zira Desktop** - Female English (US) voice 
- **Microsoft Mark Desktop** - Male English (US) voice (on some systems)

These voices are available immediately without any additional setup.

Change the voice:
```powershell
BovineShell -Message "I sound different now" -Voice "Microsoft Zira Desktop"
```

List available voices on your system:
```powershell
BovineShell-voices
```

   - Select additional languages to install their voices

2. **Language Packs**:

```powershell
"Hello $env:saedarm! I've noticed you're running Windows $((Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem).Version) on this $((Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem).Model).
